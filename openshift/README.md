After following the rule for the [gist I made](https://gist.github.com/jontrossbach/64a65a453f277a6cdc9c40c2c04d2ec5) Postgres Deployment is working. I had help from the openshift console b\
utton for `Create Deployment`

# TODO Redis and Discourse DeploymentConfig to Deployment conversion

# TODO figure out replacement for DeploymentConfig features like git hooks and triggers
